This is a React template powered by Vite to create fast and scalable single-page applications. It comes with minimal setup, hot module replacement (HMR), and ESLint integration for clean and maintainable code.

## Features
- ⚡ Fast and modern development environment using Vite.
- 🔥 Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant feedback.
- 📏 Linting set up with ESLint for better code quality.
- 🎨 Easy-to-customize React setup for your portfolio or any other project.
- 🛠️ Supports both Babel and SWC plugins for React support.

## Available Plugins
Currently, two official plugins are available for React:

1. **@vitejs/plugin-react**
   - Uses **Babel** for Fast Refresh and is the default choice for most React applications.

2. **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc**
   - Uses **SWC** for Fast Refresh and faster build times.
